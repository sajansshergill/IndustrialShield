# IndustrialShield - Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Manufacturing Environments

# ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement:
Manufacturing systems are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks due to their reliance on legacy industrial control 
systems and limited real-time threat detection. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning-based IDS 
to detect intrusions in real-time using labeled network traffic data and apply it to manufacturing IT/OT infrastructure.

# ðŸ§  Solution Approach:
1. Data Collection
- Download and use cybersecurity datasets:
- NSL-KDD or CICIDS2017 (for supervised learning)
- Simulate industrial IoT attack data using TON_IoT dataset if desired.
- Clean and balance the dataset.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify most frequent attack types.
- Visualize distributions of duration, protocol type, byte flow, etc.
- Correlate features to intrusion labels.

3. Feature Engineering
- One-hot encode categorical features like protocol and service.
- Normalize numerical features (duration, src_bytes).
- Create new features (e.g., bytes per second, session length).

4. Model Building
- Use algorithms like:
  I. Random Forest
  II. XGBoost
  III. Autoencoders (for anomaly detection)
  IV. Train/Test split, evaluate with:
  V. Accuracy
  VI. Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  VII. ROC-AUC curve

5. Dashboard Development
- Streamlit or Flask app to visualize:
  I. Real-time predictions
  II. Feature importance
  III. Intrusion severity score
  IV. Optional: Include log uploader or alert system via email

6. Documentation & Reporting
- Summarize architecture, model results, and business relevance.
- Include diagrams showing ML pipeline & threat detection flow.
