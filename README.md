# 🛡️ IndustrialShield - ML-Based Intrusion Detection for Manufacturing IoT

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Industrial networks using protocols like Modbus are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. This project develops a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to classify and detect attacks from labeled Modbus traffic.

### 🔬 Workflow Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and scaled Modbus traffic features.
2. **EDA & Visualization**: Histograms, box plots, and correlations to detect patterns and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: One-hot encoding, normalization, outlier consideration.
4. **Modeling**: Trained and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest.  
   🔸 *Random Forest outperformed others after tuning.*  
   🔸 *XGBoost was excluded due to compatibility issues.*
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC Curve, and Learning Curves.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV used to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
7. **Conclusion**: Random Forest offered a balance of performance and interpretability.

### 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of ML to secure industrial IoT systems via anomaly detection in Modbus traffic. We trained several models, with Random Forest emerging as the most balanced in terms of performance and interpretability. Future improvements include SHAP-based explainability, real-time dashboard alerts, and time-series-based intrusion detection.
